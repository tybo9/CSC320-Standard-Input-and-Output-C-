# CSC320-Standard-Input-and-Output-C-

Complete problems 1 and 4 from section 10.7 in the glorious lecture notes. This section focuses on standard input and output in C, and it gives you exposure to bit operations in the language. These are essential tools for systems level programmers, and people using C usually focus on the system/optimal approach. 

You should add text prompts to the user displaying the results, so you will need to create a main loop. You may also submit both functions in a single c file (preferred). One C file that calls the functions you create to solve these prompts works wonderfully.
